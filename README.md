# ApplicationDopamine
# This is a little app I put together. It took me one afternnon (if it helps at how slow/fast I am). It was meant for the specific job 
# application at a Bulgarian company, called "Dopamine". 
# The idea is that you roll the dices and you need to get a total of 7 or two equal dice values to earn $ 100 or $ 50 respectively or 
# else you loose $ 100 and this goes on until you spend all of your initial $ 1000. 
# Every time you succeed you get some fireworks and everytime you fail they stop immediatley. 
# You can also make it more fur winning or losing money when you hit the play button, which enables the Motorhead mode. Naturally, the song
# is "called the Ace of Spades" since gambling is forr fools, but that's the way we like it, for we shall not live forever! 

# BTW: if you want to use it - great, if not - also great - so no moiture! ;) ;) 

# All the Best from me, 
# Peter Y.
